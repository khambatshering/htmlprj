            Organic farming appears to generate 30% more employment in rural areas and labor achieves higher 
        smallholdersâ€™ access to markets and thus income generation; and relocalizes food production in 
        Generally, organic yields are 20% less as compared to high-input systems in developed countries but 
        could be up to 180% higher as compared to low-input systems in arid/semi-arid areas. In humid areas, 
        rice paddy yields are equal, while the productivity of the main crop is reduced for perennials, though 
        agroforestry provides additional goods.
        Operating costs (seeds, rent, repairs and labor) in organic agriculture are significantly lower than 
        conventional production, ranging from 50-60% for cereals and legumes, to 20-25% for dairy cows and 
        10-20% for horticulture products. This is due to lower input costs on synthetic inputs, lower irrigation 
        costs, and labor cash costs that include both family labor and hired workers. Total costs are, however, 
        only slightly lower than conventional, as fixed costs (such as land, buildings and machinery) increase 
        due to new investments during conversion (e.g. new orchards, animal houses) and certification.
